WHAT IS THIS?
=============

This is a throwaway script to get all extensions to Mediawiki, check them out and merge them into one gigantic repo. 
Don't get the purpose? Ask https://github.com/jeroendedauw

This script depends on gitpython. Get it here: https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython

INSTALL GITPYTHON
=================

If you have downloaded the source code:

  python setup.py install

or if you want to obtain a copy more easily: 

    easy_install gitpython
    
A distribution package can be obtained for manual installation at:

    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/GitPython

RUN THE SCRIPT
==============

  python subtree.py

It's as easy as that. It might take a second or two, though.
